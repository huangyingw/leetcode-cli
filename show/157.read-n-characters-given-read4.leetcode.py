#
# The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.
#
# The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it
# returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.
#
# By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n)
# that reads n characters from the file.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: buf = "abc", n = 4
# Output: "abc"
# Explanation: The actual number of characters read is 3, which is "abc".
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: buf = "abcde", n = 5
# Output: "abcde"
#
#
# Note:
# The read function will only be called once for each test case.
#
#
# The read4 API is already defined for you.
# @param buf, a list of characters
# @return an integer
# def read4(buf):
