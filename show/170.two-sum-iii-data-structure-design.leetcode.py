#
# Design and implement a TwoSum class. It should support the following
# operations: add and find.
# 
# add - Add the number to an internal data structure.
# find - Find if there exists any pair of numbers which sum is equal to the
# value.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# add(1); add(-1); 
# find(0) -> true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# add(1); add(3); add(5);
# find(4) -> true
# find(7) -> false
#
