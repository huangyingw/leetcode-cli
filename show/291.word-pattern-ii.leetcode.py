#
# Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
# ‚Å†Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a
# letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.
# 
# Examples:
# 
# pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue" should return true.
# pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd" should return true.
# pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc" should return false.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Notes:
# You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.
#
