#
#
# You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target,
# S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one
# from + and - as its new symbol.
# ⁠
#
# Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to
# target S.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3.
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
#
# -1+1+1+1+1 = 3
# +1-1+1+1+1 = 3
# +1+1-1+1+1 = 3
# +1+1+1-1+1 = 3
# +1+1+1+1-1 = 3
#
# There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
#
#
#
# Note:
#
# The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
# The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
# Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.
