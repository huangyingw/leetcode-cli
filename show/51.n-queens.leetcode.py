#
# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard
# such that no two queens attack each other.
# 
# 
# 
# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
# 
# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens'
# placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space
# respectively.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: 4
# Output: [
# ⁠[".Q..",  // Solution 1
# ⁠ "...Q",
# ⁠ "Q...",
# ⁠ "..Q."],
# 
# ⁠["..Q.",  // Solution 2
# ⁠ "Q...",
# ⁠ "...Q",
# ⁠ ".Q.."]
# ]
# Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as
# shown above.
