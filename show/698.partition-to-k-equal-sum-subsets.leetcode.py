#
# Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, find whether it's
# possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all
# equal.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
# Output: True
# Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3),
# (2,3) with equal sums.
#
#
#
# Note:
# 1 .
# 0 < nums[i] < 10000.
